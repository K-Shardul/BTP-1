# Design and Finite Element Modelling of Stochastically Generated Composite Microstructures
This project aimed at exploring different methods to model a composite material in which the second phase is placed randomly inside the matrix.
The application of the Gilbert-Johnsonan-Keerthi algorithm is explained. Other than that, a more straightforward procedure for collision detection
is elucidated.
